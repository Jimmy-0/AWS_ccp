## AWS Global Infrastructure
- AZ (Availability Zones): One or more discrete data centers
- GR(Geographic Regions): Physical location in the world with multiple AZs
- EL (Edge Location): A datacenter owned by a trusted AWS partner and has a **direct connection** to the AWS network
    - Used for getting or uploading data fast to AWS
    - These locations serve requests for `CloudFront` and `Route53`
        - Requests going to either of these services will be routed to the nearest EL automatically
    - `S3 Transfer Acceleration` traffic and `API Gateway` endpoint traffic also use the AWS Edge Network
    - Allow for low latency, no matter where the end user is geographically located
- GCR (GovCloud Regions): Allow customers to host sensitive Controlled Unclassified Information and other types of regulated workloads
    - Only accessible to US entities and root account holders who pass a screening process
    - For government, classified data

## Network
- [AWS account[Region[VPC[AZ[Subnet.public[EC2],Subnet.privat[RDS DB]]]]]]
- `VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)`: A logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources
- `NACLs (Network Access Control List)`: Firewalls at the subnet level
- `Subnets`: A logical partition of an IP network into multiple, smaller network segments
## DB
- Dynamo DB: NoSQL k-v DB
- RDS: MySQL,Postgres... SQL
- Aurora: MySQL and PSQL DB fully managed, also provide serverless (lambda)
    - serverless: Good for development or infrequently used apps
    - Aurora is highly available and durable, and when you have a cluster, it will run 6 copies of the DB across 3 AZs (more expensive than RDS)
- Redshift: Columnar DB, petabyte data warehouse
- ElastiCache: Redis
### Buzz Words

    - Snapshot or copy of the entire server
    - In EC2 > Instances, do Actions > Image > Create Image
    - Once we have an AMI, we can launch another copy of this server/instance

- `CloudFront`
    - Used as a CDN (content distribution network)
    - Can share static files across the globe by copying them to multiple edge locations across the world and will be accessible from those ELs
    - Traffic will hit the domain name, and then it will route the traffic to the nearest EL
